_There are two distinct paths that can be taken on Retro. One requires significantly less trial and error, however, both will work. Please check writeups if you are curious regarding the two paths. An alternative version of this room is available in it's remixed version [Blaster](https://tryhackme.com/room/blaster)_.

### Enumeration & Exploitation

* Scan open port with `nmap`

	```
	nmap $IP -A -p- -oN nmap-scan -Pn
	```

	![nmap](./images/nmap.png)

	We found open port on 80 (HTTP) and 3389 (RDP)

* Scan directory list with `Gobuster`

	```
	gobuster dir -u  $IP -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50 -o gobuster-scan
	```

	![gobuster](./images/gobuster.png)

	We got directory **/retro**

* Browsing into **/retro** directory

	![web1](./images/web1.png)

	We found the author is **Wade** & exploring posts by **Wade**

	![web2](./images/web2.png)

* We know from nmap that host machine has set RDP port open. Connect to it using username Author and password from the comment.

	```
	xfreerdp /v:$IP /u:Wade /p:'parzival'
	```

	![rdp](./images/rdp.png)
