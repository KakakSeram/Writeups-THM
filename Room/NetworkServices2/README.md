## Task 1 - Get Connected

Hello and welcome!

This room is a sequel to the first network services room. Similarly, it will explore a few more common Network Service vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that you're likely to find in CTFs, and some penetration test scenarios.

I would encourage you to complete the first network services room (https://tryhackme.com/room/networkservices) before attempting this one.

As with the previous room, it is definitely worth having a basic knowledge of Linux before attempting this room. If you think you'll need some help with this, try completing the 'Linux Fundamentals' module (https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals)

Before we get started:

1. Connect to the TryHackMe OpenVPN Server (See https://tryhackme.com/access for help!)
2. Make sure you're sitting comfortably, and have a cup of Tea, Coffee or Water close!

Lets get started!

**N.B.** This is not a room on WiFi access hacking or hijacking, rather how to gain unauthorized access to a machine by exploiting network services. If you are interested in WiFi hacking, I suggest checking out WiFi Hacking 101 by NinjaJc01 (https://tryhackme.com/room/wifihacking101)

Ready? Let's get going!

## Task 2 - Understanding NFS

![task2](./images/task2.png)

**What is NFS?**

NFS stands for "Network File System" and allows a system to share directories and files with others over a network. By using NFS, users and programs can access files on remote systems almost as if they were local files. It does this by mounting all, or a portion of a file system on a server. The portion of the file system that is mounted can be accessed by clients with whatever privileges are assigned to each file.

**How does NFS work?**

We don't need to understand the technical exchange in too much detail to be able to exploit NFS effectively- however if this is something that interests you, I would recommend this resource: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/816-4882/6mb2ipq7l/index.html

First, the client will request to mount a directory from a remote host on a local directory just the same way it can mount a physical device. The mount service will then act to connect to the relevant mount daemon using RPC.

The server checks if the user has permission to mount whatever directory has been requested. It will then return a file handle which uniquely identifies each file and directory that is on the server.

If someone wants to access a file using NFS, an RPC call is placed to NFSD (the NFS daemon) on the server. This call takes parameters such as:

* The file handle
* The name of the file to be accessed
* The user's, user ID
* The user's group ID

These are used in determining access rights to the specified file. This is what controls user permissions, I.E read and write of files.

**What runs NFS?**

Using the NFS protocol, you can transfer files between computers running Windows and other non-Windows operating systems, such as Linux, MacOS or UNIX.

A computer running Windows Server can act as an NFS file server for other non-Windows client computers. Likewise, NFS allows a Windows-based computer running Windows Server to access files stored on a non-Windows NFS server.

**More Information:**

Here are some resources that explain the technical implementation, and working of, NFS in more detail than I have covered here.

## Task 3 - Enumerating NFS

**Let's Get Started**

Before we begin, make sure to deploy the room and give it some time to boot. Please be aware - this can take up to five minutes so be patient!

**What is Enumeration?**

Enumeration is defined as "a process which establishes an active connection to the target hosts to discover potential attack vectors in the system, and the same can be used for further exploitation of the system." - [Infosec Institute](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/what-is-enumeration/). It is a critical phase when considering how to enumerate and exploit a remote machine - as the information you will use to inform your attacks will come from this stage

**Requirements**

In order to do a more advanced enumeration of the NFS server, and shares- we're going to need a few tools. The first of which is key to interacting with any NFS share from your local machine: **nfs-common**.

**NFS-Common**

It is important to have this package installed on any machine that uses NFS, either as client or server. It includes programs such as: **lockd**, **statd**, **showmount**, **nfsstat**, **gssd**, **idmapd** and **mount.nfs**. Primarily, we are concerned with "showmount" and "mount.nfs" as these are going to be most useful to us when it comes to extracting information from the NFS share. If you'd like more information about this package, feel free to read: https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/nfs-common.

You can install **nfs-common** using "sudo apt install nfs-common", it is part of the default repositories for most Linux distributions such as the Kali Remote Machine or AttackBox that is provided to TryHackMe.

**Port Scanning**

Port scanning has been covered many times before, so I'll only cover the basics that you need for this room here. If you'd like to learn more about **nmap** in more detail please have a look at the [nmap](https://tryhackme.com/room/furthernmap) room.

The first step of enumeration is to conduct a port scan, to find out as much information as you can about the services, open ports and operating system of the target machine. You can go as in-depth as you like on this, however, I suggest using **nmap** with the -**A** and -**p**- tags.

**Mounting NFS shares**

Your clientâ€™s system needs a directory where all the content shared by the host server in the export folder can be accessed. You can create
this folder anywhere on your system. Once you've created this mount point, you can use the "mount" command to connect the NFS share to the mount point on your machine like so:

**sudo mount -t nfs IP:share /tmp/mount/ -nolock**

Let's break this down
	
|Tag|Function|
|---|--------|
|sudo|Run as root|
|mount|Execute the mount command|
|-t nfs|Type of device to mount, then specifying that it's NFS|
|IP:share|The IP Address of the NFS server, and the name of the share we wish to mount|
|-nolock|Specifies not to use NLM locking|

Now we understand our tools, let's get started!

### Answer the questions

* Conduct a thorough port scan scan of your choosing, how many ports are open?

	``

* Which port contains the service we're looking to enumerate?

	``

* Now, use /usr/sbin/showmount -e [IP] to list the NFS shares, what is the name of the visible share?

	``

Time to mount the share to our local machine!

First, use "mkdir /tmp/mount" to create a directory on your machine to mount the share to. This is in the /tmp directory- so be aware that it will be removed on restart.

* Then, use the mount command we broke down earlier to mount the NFS share to your local machine. Change directory to where you mounted the share- what is the name of the folder inside?

	``

Have a look inside this directory, look at the files. Looks like  we're inside a user's home directory...

* Interesting! Let's do a bit of research now, have a look through the folders. Which of these folders could contain keys that would give us remote access to the server?

	``

* Which of these keys is most useful to us?

	``

Copy this file to a different location your local machine, and change the permissions to "600" using "chmod 600 [file]".

Assuming we were right about what type of directory this is, we can pretty easily work out the name of the user this key corresponds to.

* Can we log into the machine using `ssh -i <key-file> <username>@<ip>` ? (Y/N)
